pseudoalgorithm:
  1. read all of the html files, keeping track of the terms, documents (urls),
  frequencies and positions.
  2. save each of these relations as a tuple, in secondary memory.
  3. at the end(at the middle???), sort the tuples with some external sort algorithm
  (most likely external quick sort).
